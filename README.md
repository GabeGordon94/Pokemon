CS-170  Final Project
Pokemon Battle GUI
	I created two programs that run a similar model code. The first one is just the base code that runs the simulation. You are asked for your name and told that a pokemon, that was picked at random, has appeared and wants to battle. You are then prompted to choose your pokemon of choice. You are given three random selections that you can use for battle. Then you are told your Pokémon’s four moves and then you see your opponent’s moves.  You pick a move to attack and it does a random damage. Then you are told that your opponent has attacked you and has done a random damage to you. You continue to pick your moves until one of your health’s hit 0. At this point, you either win or lose. 	
	Similarly, the second program does the simulation within a GUI. This was very difficult to create and doesn’t run perfectly. You are asked your name and then you press a button “greet”. Then it greets you and tells you a random pokemon has appeared, similar to the first part. Then you choose your pokemon for battle and you see 4 buttons of your moves and 4 of his. You get to press the button and you are expected to see his health go down and he randomly attacks you and your health decreases as well. This happens until one of your health’s hit 0 and then it displays “Game Over”. 
	I wanted this program to be the very best, like no code there ever was.
